# Muhammad Syukri - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About Me
Hi, I'm Muhammad Syukri. I prefer to be called Syukri. I have an analytical background in Geology and Geotechnical Engineering. I have a Master's Degree in Geotechnical Engineering (MPhil. Geotechnical Engineering) and I'm planning to get Master's Degree in Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in geology and the geotechnical part of geology and a passion for using data to analyse and uncover meaningful insight in the geology field using software like gINT, ArcGIS and MATLAB. As of now, I keep developing my skills and knowledges in the field of data science for me to contribute back to any field of work in the future that involves data analytics. I am also very excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as entry-level data specialists.

During my studies, I have honed my ability to work with complex structured data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experiences in laboratory techniques, data managemnet skills, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets if in the future I was given an opportunity to be a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoying exploring new programming languages in order to broaden my knowledge about other programming knowledges such as Java, C++ and many more. Moreover, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for oppportunities to expand my knowledges and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

I have also attached my Curriculum Vitae (CV) [here](https://github.com/syukrifadzil/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Syukri%20Fadzil%20CV.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in the Data Analytics/Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will outline data analytics projects and provide a brief overview of the technology stack used to address each case.

### Analysis of the Factors that can Contribute to Success for a Movie
**Code:** ['Analysis of the Factors that can Contribute to Success for a Movie.ipynb'](https://github.com/syukrifadzil/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Analysis%20on%20Factors%20that%20can%20Contribute%20to%20Success%20for%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project involved analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022, containing details such as titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other key attributes. The process included data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA). Additionally, the project examined the correlation between budget and gross earnings, utilizing Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data analysis, Correlation mattrices, hypothesis testing, Data visualization.

**Library Used:** Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy.

**Results:** Through Python functions, the analysis revealed that votes and budget had the strongest correlation with gross earnings, while the production company showed no significant correlation.

### Analysis for an Electric Store Sales in 2019
**Code:** ['Analysis for an Electric Store Sales in 2019.ipynb'](https://github.com/syukrifadzil/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Analysis%20for%20an%20Electric%20Store%20Sales%20in%202019%20.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze the store's sales history, extract insights on its performance, and identify potential areas for improvement.

**Description:** The dataset consists of sales records, including product details and order information such as order ID, order date, price, quantity ordered, and purchase address. The project involves several key steps: data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), sales data analysis, and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data analysis, Hypothesis testing, Data visualization.

**Library Used:** Pandas, Matplotlib

**Results:** Python functions were used to calculate and visually present sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to determine the reasons behind the high sales frequency of these items, providing valuable insights.
